"What is the function of RNA polymerase II?","RNA polymerase II transcribes protein-coding genes into mRNA in eukaryotes."
"What is the preinitiation complex (PIC)?","A large assembly of RNA polymerase II and general transcription factors (GTFs) at the core promoter, required for transcription initiation."
"What role does TFIIH play in transcription?","TFIIH has helicase activity to unwind DNA and kinase activity to phosphorylate RNA polymerase II, enabling transcription elongation."
"How do enhancers regulate transcription?","Enhancers are DNA sequences that increase transcription efficiency by looping DNA and interacting with activators and RNA polymerase II at the promoter."
"What is a silencer in transcription?","A DNA sequence that binds repressor proteins to inhibit transcription by modifying chromatin structure or interfering with transcription factor binding."
"What are the three main mechanisms of transcriptional repression?","Histone deacetylation, histone methylation, and DNA methylation at CpG islands."
"What is combinatorial control of transcription?","The regulation of a single gene by multiple DNA regulatory sites and transcription factors, ensuring precise gene expression."
"What is the significance of Oct4 in transcription?","Oct4 is a key transcription factor required for maintaining pluripotency in embryonic stem cells."
"How can transcription factors induce pluripotency?","By introducing a small set of transcription factors into a differentiated cell, it can be reprogrammed into an induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)."
"What is the role of histone acetylation in transcription?","Histone acetylation reduces histone-DNA interaction, loosening chromatin and increasing transcription."
"What is the role of DNA methylation in transcription?","DNA methylation at CpG islands represses transcription by preventing transcription factor binding and recruiting chromatin-modifying enzymes."
"How do coactivators regulate transcription?","Coactivators, such as those with histone acetyltransferase (HAT) activity, help activate transcription by modifying chromatin and stabilizing transcription factors."
"How does DNA looping facilitate transcription?","DNA looping allows distant enhancers or silencers to interact with the promoter, bringing transcription activators or repressors into close proximity with RNA polymerase II."
"What is the function of TATA-binding protein (TBP)?","TBP is a subunit of TFIID that binds to the TATA box and helps initiate transcription by recruiting RNA polymerase II."
"What happens if TFIIH is defective?","If TFIIH is defective, transcription initiation is impaired due to the inability to unwind DNA or phosphorylate RNA polymerase II, leading to reduced gene expression."
"Why is transcription regulation essential in eukaryotic cells?","Eukaryotic cells require transcription regulation to ensure gene expression is tissue-specific, time-dependent, and responsive to environmental cues."
"What is the role of mediator complex in transcription?","The mediator complex bridges activators at enhancers with RNA polymerase II at the promoter, facilitating transcription initiation."
"How do transcription factors influence gene expression?","Transcription factors bind to specific DNA sequences to either activate or repress transcription by recruiting coactivators or corepressors."
"What are general transcription factors (GTFs)?","GTFs are proteins required for RNA polymerase II to recognize and bind promoters, forming the preinitiation complex for transcription initiation."
"What is the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) motif?","It is a conserved region of about 50 amino acids found in some eukaryotic regulatory proteins that helps control gene expression. It features two short amphipathic alpha helices connected by a variable-length loop, allowing the formation of homo- or heterodimers. DNA binding is mediated by a nearby region rich in basic residues."
"What key functions does the bHLH motif provide?","It facilitates both DNA binding and protein dimerization in transcription factors."
"How does the loop in the bHLH motif influence the protein structure?","The loop of variable length connects the two alpha helices, allowing flexibility and enabling the formation of either homo- or heterodimers."
"Which eukaryotic transcription factors exhibit the bHLH motif?","Examples include HIF, Myc, and MyoD."
"Why are basic residues important in the bHLH motif?","They mediate DNA binding by forming interactions with the negatively charged phosphate backbone of DNA."
